In the previous sections, we talk about Docker and we saw how we can download an image and launch a container.  
Here, we are going to explain how to interact with the Docker daemon using the Docker CLI and how we can create our custom images.

## The Docker CLI
The Docker Engine is shipped out with a docker CLI client application.
You can interact with docker using the *docker* command:

Docker CLI commands are self-explanatory: hovewer, we will see briefly the most important ones.
### Show all the downloaded images
You can get a list of all the images that you have downloaded with the command **docker images** (or **docker image ls**):
{% highlight bash %}
~/Projects/sw-arch/docker docker images
REPOSITORY               TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
golang                   latest    57ca605b665e   12 hours ago   814MB
httpd                    latest    7860e7628717   31 hours ago   168MB
docker/getting-started   latest    3e4394f6b72f   8 months ago   47MB
{% endhighlight %}
### Download an image from the Docker Hub
What about downloading an image? Just type <b>docker pull *&lt;name-of-image:tag&gt;*</b> (example: **docker pull nodejs:latest**).  
Tag permits to specify which version of the Docker image you want to use. If you don't specify a tag, the latest available image will be pulled.
You can see all the available tags for an image directly from the Docker Hub (for example, for node: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/node/tags">hub.docker.com/_/node/tags</a>).
{% highlight bash %}
~/Projects/sw-arch/docker docker pull node:latest
latest: Pulling from library/node

00046d1e755e: Already exists

As we mention before, an image is composed of layers, that are images themselves. When you download an image, you download the layers that compose that image and this is clearly visible by the logs of the docker pull command (i.e., 012c0b3e998c, 00046d1e755e, 9f13f5a53d11 are the first three layers that compose this image). This permits to avoid redownloading a layer if you have already pulled it for another image. On the example above, we have that the first three layers already exists in local, so Docker skips the download of these layers.  

The downloaded image is then visible inside Docker Desktop:
